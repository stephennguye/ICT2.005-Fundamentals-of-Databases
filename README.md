# ICT2.005 Fundamentals of Databases

This repository contains my labwork and submissions for the **ICT2.005 Fundamentals of Databases** course at the University of Science and Technology Hanoi (USTH), where I learned to design, implement, and query relational databases using **MySQL**. The work demonstrates my understanding of database concepts, SQL programming, and data management techniques.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
The Fundamentals of Databases course focused on:
- Understanding relational database concepts and data modeling.
- Writing SQL queries to manage and retrieve data efficiently.
- Applying normalization techniques to design optimized database schemas.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Topics Learned
Throughout the course, I explored and practiced:
1. **Database Design & Modeling**  
   - Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, relational schemas.
2. **Relational Database Concepts**  
   - Tables, keys (primary, foreign), relationships, and constraints.
3. **Structured Query Language (SQL)**  
   - Data Definition Language (DDL): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.  
   - Data Manipulation Language (DML): `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.  
   - Data Query Language (DQL): `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.
4. **Normalization**  
   - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
5. **Indexes & Views**  
   - Enhancing query performance and data abstraction.
6. **Transactions & ACID Properties**  
   - Ensuring consistency, reliability, and integrity in database operations.
